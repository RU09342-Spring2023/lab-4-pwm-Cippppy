# Software PWM
Most microprocessors will have a Timer module, but depending on the device, some may not come with pre-built PWM modules. Instead, you may have to utilize software techniques to synthesize PWM on your own.

## Task
You need to generate a 1kHz PWM signal with a duty cycle between 0% and 100%. Upon the processor starting up, you should PWM both of the on-board LEDs at a 50% duty cycle. Upon pressing the on-board buttons, the duty cycle of the LEDs should increase by 10%, based on which button you press. Once you have reached 100%, your duty cycle should go back to 0% on the next button press.
 - Button 2.1 Should control LED 1.0
 - Button 4.3 should control LED 6.6

## Deliverables
You will need to upload the .c file and a README explaining your code and any design decisions made.

### Hints
You really, really, really, really need to hook up the output of your LED pin to an oscilloscope to make sure that the duty cycle is accurate. Also, since you are going to be doing a lot of initialization, it would be helpful for all persons involved if you created your main function like:

```c
int main(void)
{
	WDTCTL = WDTPW | WDTHOLD;	// stop watchdog timer
	LEDSetup(); // Initialize our LEDS
	ButtonSetup();  // Initialize our button
	TimerA0Setup(); // Initialize Timer0
	TimerA1Setup(); // Initialize Timer1
	__bis_SR_register(LPM0_bits + GIE);       // Enter LPM0 w/ interrupt
}
```

This way, each of the steps in initialization can be isolated for easier understanding and debugging.


## Extra Work
### Linear Brightness
Much like every other things with humans, not everything we interact with we perceive as linear. For senses such as sight or hearing, certain features such as volume or brightness have a logarithmic relationship with our senses. Instead of just incrementing by 10%, try making the brightness appear to change linearly.
